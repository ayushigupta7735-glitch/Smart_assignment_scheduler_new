# Smart Assignment Scheduler
### Deadline-Based Daily Planning for Students — Java CLI Application

---

## Problem Statement

Students frequently underestimate the time required to complete large assignments. Without a structured plan, work gets deferred until the last day, resulting in poor-quality submissions, missed deadlines, and unnecessary stress. Most calendar apps simply set a reminder — they do not *plan the work*.

This project solves that by automatically distributing assignment workload across available days, factoring in difficulty and deadline urgency, so the student always knows exactly what to work on today.

| Persistent Storage | Assignments saved to `data/assignments.txt` and reloaded on startup |

### Advanced Features
| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Difficulty Weighting | Hard assignments front-load work to earlier days |

## Technologies Used

- **Java 11+**
- `java.time.LocalDate` — date handling and deadline arithmetic
- `ArrayList`, `LinkedHashMap` — in-memory data structures
- `BufferedReader` / `BufferedWriter` — file I/O for persistence
- `Scanner` — interactive CLI input
- Object-Oriented Design — 5 classes with clear single responsibilities
- Exception Handling — `try-catch` throughout for robust input/file errors
